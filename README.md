# Adding addon Guide
1. Create a folder with a *unique name* in *lowercase*. (**Example**: `faithful_mobs`)
2. Add an image file and the `info.yml` to the created folder
3. Edit `info.yml`

In `info.yml`, if you don't have an `URL`, leave it empty!

**TIP**: Use already added addons as template for yours because it is easier to understand!
